= Simple Language Loadout Tables for Mothership 1e

These tables are built to be used with the _Weapons & Damage_ table on page 2, the _Armor_ table on page 2, the _Equipment_ table on pages 34 and 35 as well as the the _Pets_ table on page 35.

Not all items are defined in those tables though.
Any item not defined there is [.underline]#underlined# and should be interpreted during the game as it makes sense in the situation, story, and universe.

Other items are described to fit the character class but use stats from a different item.
In those cases, the items from which stats should be used are noted with "(as _item_)".
